        "selftext": "I'm 7 months pregnant. I'm at the point where I'm large and uncomfortable and regular sex is getting awkward. I'm also dealing with a lot of pain in my back, hips, and legs. So, we decided to just play around. Kinda felt like my teenage years when i didn't want to give it up, yet. He got me off a few times with mouth and fingers. It was amazing. \n\nI went down to return the favor. I was getting into it and doing my best work. Just as he was coming in my mouth, I suddenly thought, \"everything I swallow goes to my baby.\"  It grossed me out. I started gagging and had to run to the bathroom and threw up all my dinner. I couldn't stop the reaction. He comes in and holds my hair and cleans up the splatter on the toilet while I'm brushing my teeth and using mouthwash. \n\nSo, now I'm worried that I've hurt my husband or made him feel like he's unattractive or something. He's not acting weird about it but I'm afraid he's bothered and hiding it, even though he's assuring me that he's not. \n\nI feel like a shitty wife. Damn hormones and overthinking brain.\n\nTLDR hormones and overthinking caused me to throw up after giving my husband a blow job because I didn't want my baby eating her siblings.\n\n\nEdit: I did explain right away. He just said, \"Well, I guess we're not doing that for a while.\" Also, I've taken biology classes. I know it's an irrational thought. Pregnancy is full of those. As for brushing my teeth, we were headed right to bed and I didn't want to sleep with puke breath so I weighed the pros and cons and figured it couldn't hurt too much to brush right after once.\n\nAlso, he found this. And he said, \"You sold our sex life for a reddit silver.\" Lmao, guess I did.",

        "selftext": "Well I went to stay the night at my girlfriends because recently I moved out of my home and have been sleeping on a couch for the last week, so I thought sleeping in a bed with my girlfriend would be really nice for a change. On top of all this, her mom wasn’t home..\n\nEverything went smooth, I fell asleep like a rock and the morning went pretty smooth in the beginning.\nThen the home door opens and it’s her mom...\nKeep in mind I’m not supposed to be here and no one is allowed over\n\nSo I made a run for the closet and as I’m writing this, this is where I currently am. As a 6’4 guy this closet is very small and my heads literally touching the top of it.\n\nTLDR: I thought with my dick, had a good sleep and now have to hide in a closet because of it\n\nUpdate 1: HER MOM CAME IN AND WAS OUTSIDE THE DOOR TALKING ABOUT PUMA PANTS THAT WERE ON SALE, EVERY BREATHE I TOOK FELT LOUDER AND LOUDER \n\nMy girlfriend quickly came up with a good bullshit excuse and she is now with her downstairs talking about clothes phew\n\nUpdate 2:\nPhone died.....\nTexted my girlfriend right before it did\nSo my girlfriend charged it up for me \n\nI’d like to tell you guys something new and exciting has happened in the hours it’s been but I’ve done nothing but twiddle my thumbs\n\nThe mom should be leaving soon and if everything goes to plan I’ll be out in an hour",
