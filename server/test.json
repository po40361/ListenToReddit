    "Tifu by telling my roommate I loved his cooking": [
        "Tifu by telling my roommate I loved his cooking\n\nSo a few weeks ago I woke up to a wonderful suprise. My roommate made me an omelette and brought it to me at my desk.  I was really happy that they went out of their way to cook for me. \n\nHowever when I took a bite I was in for a suprise. It was a cold omelette with horseradish Swiss cheese, sour raisins, and prunes. It was... disturbingly gross. I couldn't even swallow one bite. I really couldn't eat it.\n\nLater in the day, my roommate came by to ask how it was. I was mostly distracted with work so I just said that I was thankful he cooked for me. \n\nBecause he doesn't cook a lot, I thought that I wouldn't have to address the abomination and we'd just go back to usual. Well... He took the positive encouragement and has started expirementing with all kinds of wierd flavour combinations.\n \nThis morning I woke up to a garlic, cheese, and dried cranberries omelette and it was even worse than the first. I feel like I'm in too deep at this point. I don't have the heart to tell him that I don't like even like omelettes. I like plain scrambled eggs. \n\nTl;Dr- My roommate made gross food. I thought it was a one time thing so I gave positive feedback. Now my life is wierd wierd omelettes.\n\nEdit: holy cow. This blew up. Just sending love and good vibes to all. May all your food be tasty, and all your roommates be as nice as mine, but may they be much much much better cooks.\n\nUpdate: for everyone offering advice, the plan is definitely to communicate that this combination is\n... heinous, but in a nice and respectful way. I'm sure they would appreciate knowing what I actually like so that their effort is edible AND a really nice thing."

    "TIFU by trying to be sexy with my husband": [
        "TIFU by trying to be sexy with my husband\n\nMy husband and I had been getting handsy all afternoon, and at dinner time I got dressed in a super short dress. While I was cooking he was sitting with our baby on the counter, and hinted that I should get something from the bottom drawer. I obliged, but then he said that something was wrong with the picture, and I quickly realized he was referring to my underwear. I took them off as sexy as I could, and bent over, when I stood back up I went to throw them at him, intending to land them on his head. However I unfortunately threw them short and landed them perfectly on our babys head instead. We then started laughing and I grabbed them off my sons head before collapsing on the floor, but our five year old heard us and got mad she missed out on the joke. \n\nTL;DR I tried to be sexy with my husband but just managed to give my son a temporary underwear hat."
